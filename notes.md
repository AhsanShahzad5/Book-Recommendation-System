we will build a Book Recommendation system

# 4 types of recommendation systems :

1. popularity based : most popular stuff on our platform , like youtube trending system , Yt , imdb have their own formula or algorithm to make this

2. Content Based : does recs according to similarity of content , for example if u r listeing to romantic music , u get more music recommendations of that genre. Interest in cricket vidoes means u get more cricket vidoes . here we use **TAGS** / **Atributes**

3. Collaborative System :
   Recommends acc to interests of users grouped together . For example , if user 1 like interstellar , and user 2 also liked it , user 1 watched a new movie inception , that would get recommended to user 2 as well , recommended on **SIMILARITY OF USERS**.
   Another example , if your friend liked a post on facebook , it also shows up on your feed
   In this project , how we do is we take all the books , and rating by each user , we form a large vector of the ratings , and then we use **similarity search** on the **user ratings vector** to recommend the movie.

4. Hybrid : combination of all 3

# Flow of project

data -> pre processing -> Model building -> make website - Deploy

# Recommendation type

Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender and Popularity , both used here separately

# Popular platforms

Like YT , Netflix , use hybrid approaches
